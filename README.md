# Student-Management-System
The Python code implements a Student Management System (SMS) using a menu-driven interface. It manages student records as Student objects, leveraging file handling (CSV format in students.txt) for persistent storage. Core features include CRUD operations, GPA analytics, and strong exception handling for input validation.
